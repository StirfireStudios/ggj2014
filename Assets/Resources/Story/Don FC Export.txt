Have you read the papers, Mavis?

Damn these modern railways. No structure. In my day we kept our tracks up to standard. None of this "falts in the line" business.
[[MFC1 Mavis 2-1]]


:: MFC1 John 3-1 [S:John T:Mavis]
Useless, these men are, useless.

Looks like it's about to get dark again. 



:: MFC1 Man Don 4-1 [S:Don T:John]
I'll leave you to your paper.


:: MFC1 Man John 4-1 [S:John T:Mavis Start:Leave]
Good riddance to bad rubbish, that's what I say.


:: MFC1 [Ignore]
A man and woman are in this compartment. The woman is looking out the window. The man is reading a paper. The headline reads "Dandelion Killer Still At Large"


:: MFC1 Mavis 1-1 [S:Mavis T:John]

Mmm hmm

[[MFC1 John 1-2]]


:: MFC1 Mavis 2-1 [S:Mavis T:John]
I know dear.

[[MFC1 John 2-2]]


:: MFC1 Mavis 3-1 [S:Mavis T:John]

Yes, dear.
[[MFC1 John 5-1]]


:: MFC1 Man Mavis 2-1 [S:Mavis T:Don]
MMM HMM!!

[[MFC1 Man Don 2-2]]


:: MFC1 Man Mavis 2-2 [S:Mavis T:Don]
That's right.

[[MFC1 Man John 2-3]]


:: MFC1 Man John 2-3 [S:John T:Don]
Now why don't you run along, before I come to my senses and give you the whipping you deserve.

[[I'm outa here.|MFC1 Man Don 4-1]]


:: MFC1 John 1-2 [S:John T:Mavis]

They still haven't caught that "Dandelion Killer". It's getting to be your aren't safe in you're own home. Isn't it, Mavis?
[[MFC1 Mavis 1-2]]


:: MFC1 John 2-2 [S:John T:Mavis]
We worked good and hard, and we were glad for the work! 

[[MFC1 Mavis 2-2]]


:: MFC1 Man John 1-1 [Start:Approach S:John T:Don]
Who are you? What are you doing here. 

[[So about that Dandelion Killer...|MFC1 Man Don 2-1]]
[[Watch your tone!|MFC1 Man Don 3-1]] 
[[Just passing through.|MFC1 Man Don 4-1]]


:: MFC1 Man Don 2-1
I'm here on an official investigation. I'll have you know I'm tracking a very dangerous man. 

[[MFC1 Man John 2-1]]


:: MFC1 Man John 2-1 [S:John T:Don]
Oh ho ho, I'll bet you are. After <color=#ffa500ff>The Dandelion Killer</color>, then?

[[MFC1 Man Mavis 2-1]]


:: MFC1 Man Don 2-2 [S:Don]
Yes, well...

[[MFC1 Man John 2-2]]


:: MFC1 Man John 2-2 [S:John T:Don]
I, for one, don't believe you for a second. And neither does my wife. 

[[MFC1 Man Mavis 2-2]]


:: MFC1 Mavis 1-2 [S:Mavis T:John]
Mmm hmm 

[[MFC1 John 2-1]]


:: MFC1 Mavis 2-2 [S:Mavis T:John]
Yes, dear.

[[MFC1 John 3-1]]


:: MFC1 Man Don 3-1 [S:Don T:John]
Don't get smart with me. I'll have you know I'm a detective!

[[MFC1 Man John 3-1]]


:: MFC1 Man John 3-1 [S:Don T:Mavis]
A detective, he says! Y'hear that, Mavis? Want's us to believe he's a detective. And wearing a suit that's older than I am, that is a right laugh.

[[MFC1 Man Mavis 3-1]]


:: MFC1 Man Don 3-2 [S:Don T:John]
Do not cross me, or I'll have you taken in. I'm sure the constables in Dining would be happy to assist me.

[[MFC1 Man John 3-2]]


:: MFC1 Man John 3-2 [S:John T:Mavis]
Have us taken in? Listen to him, Mavis. This young upstart has the gall to suggest... I'll not be slave to this harassment. 

[[MFC1 Man Mavis 3-2]]


:: MFC1 Man Don 3-3 [S:Don T:John]
Well... You see...

--

I'll forgive you, but only this once.
[[MFC1 Man John 3-3]]


:: MFC1 Man John 3-3 [S:John T:Don]
You still haven't answered me, boy. What are you doing here?

[[About that Dandelion Killer...|MFC1 Man Don 2-1]]
[[Maybe I should go.|MFC1 Man Don 4-1]]

And then Georgia said to Clarice that he needed to ask permission first, but Clarice said that was outdated.
[[CFC2 Sally 1-1]]


:: CFC2 Beth 2-1 [S:Beth T:Sally]
That's different, you see, because Elton is from the Wentworth family. And we all know that they haven't got enough money to their name for that to be a suitable match.
[[CFC2 Sally 2-1]]


:: CFC2 Beth 3-1 [S:Beth T:Sally]
True, true, but Darcy's family has been around for at least ten generations. 

[[CFC2 Sally 3-1]]


:: CFC2 Beth 4-1 [S:Beth T:Sally]
She has to marry someone, though. And soon! She's nearly 25 already. Who would you have her be with, Leeroy Jenkins?

[[CFC2 Sally 4-1]]


:: CFC2 Beth 5-1 [S:Beth T:Sally]
Oh but that's such an outdated custom, not suitable for this day and age. It's the twenties, Sally, you must move with the times!

[[CFC2 Sally 5-1]]


:: MFC1 Man Mavis 3-1 [S:Mavis]
Mmm hmm

[[MFC1 Man Don 3-2]]


:: MFC1 Man Mavis 3-2 [S:Mavis]
Mmm hmm...

[[MFC1 Man Don 3-3]]


:: CFC2 Sally 1-1 [S:Sally T:Beth]
But didn't Elton ask permission before marrying Clarice?
[[CFC2 Beth 2-1]]


:: CFC2 Sally 2-1 [S:Sally T:Beth]
But Darcy's family certainly isn't well-off. They barely make enough to afford their estate!

[[CFC2 Beth 3-1]]


:: CFC2 Sally 3-1 [S:Sally T:Beth]
Prestige is very well and good, but how does he expect to support Georgia when his house is barely making ends meet?

[[CFC2 Beth 4-1]]


:: CFC2 Sally 4-1 [S:Sally T:Beth]
At least Leeroy would ask her father before asking for her hand!

[[CFC2 Beth 5-1]]


:: CFC2 Sally 5-1 [S:Sally T:Beth]
All I'm saying is that if a man wishes to ask for my hand, he had better ask my father first.


:: MFC2 [Ignore]
Two women are chatting about a tennis match.




:: MFC2 Man Don 1-1 [S:Don]
Sorry to interrupt, ladies, but I'm on a case.

[[MFC2 Man Beth 1-1]]


:: MFC2 Man Beth 1-1 [S:Beth T:Don]
What, the case of the ill-made suit? I've solved that one for you already.

[[MFC2 Man Sally 1-2]]


:: MFC2 Man Sally 1-2 [S:Sally T:Beth]
Oh, don't be unkind. He can't help it if he has incredibly poor taste in men's wear.

[[MFC2 Man Sally 1-3]]


:: MFC2 Man Sally 1-3 [S:Sally T:Don]
So tell me, <i>sir</i>, what "case" is this that has you behvaing so rudely?

[[I'm solving a murder|MFC2 Man Don 1-3]]
[[IHave you seen any strange men around?|MFC2 Man Don 2-1]]
[[I Don't want to cause a panic.|MFC2 Man Don 3-1]]
[[I have to go.|MFC2 Man Don 4-1]]



:: MFC2 Man Don 1-3 [S:Don T:Sally]
I don't mean to alarm you, but there's been some foul play on this train. 

[[MFC2 Man Beth 1-3]]


:: MFC2 Man Beth 1-3 [S:Beth T:Don]
I'll say! You positively reek!

[[MFC2 Man Don 1-4]]


:: MFC2 Man Don 1-4 [S:Don T:Beth]
This is no joke, <i>madam</i>. Your very lives could be in danger!

[[MFC2 Man Sally 1-4]]


:: MFC2 Man Sally 1-4 [S:Sally T:Don]
And who, pray tell, do you expect them to be in danger from?

:: MFC3 Jessie 1-1 [Start:Approach S:Jessie]
Where's my mummy?

[[MFC3 Don 1-1]]


:: MFC3 Don 1-1 [S:Don]
Sorry, kid, I can't help you.



:: MFC3 Jessie 1-2 [Star:Leave S:Jessie]
He's so angry.


:: MFC2 Man Sally 1-1 [Start:Approach S:Sally T:Don]
Do you mind? We were having a private conversation.

[[I'm a dick.|MFC2 Man Don 1-1]]
[[Have you seen any strange men around?|MFC2 Man Don 2-1]]
[[Oh, sorry.|MFC2 Man Don 4-1]]


:: MFC2 Man Don 2-1 [S:Don T:Sally]
Have you seen any strange men around?

[[MFC2 Man Sally 2-1]]


:: MFC2 Man Don 3-1 [S:Don T:Sally]
It's probably best if I don't say anything. I wouldn't want to scare you. 

[[MFC2 Man Beth 3-1]]


:: MFC2 Man Don 1-5 [S:Don T:Sally]
There's been...

A murder.

[[MFC2 Man Sally 1-5]]


:: MFC2 Man Sally 2-1 [S:Sally T:Don]
Stranger than you? I should hardly think so. 

[[MFC2 Man Beth 2-1]]


:: MFC2 Man Don 2-2 [S:Don T:Beth]
No business, none at all. I should probably leave you two in peace.

[[MFC2 Man Beth 3-1]]


:: MFC2 Man Sally 1-5 [S:Sally T:Don]
<size=55>Oh my goodness! Are we safe?</size>

[[MFC2 Man Don 1-6]]


:: MFC2 Man Don 4-1 [S:Don T:Sally]
I have to go.



:: MFC2 Man Beth 2-1 [S:Beth T:Don]
What business is it of yours, anyway?

[[MFC2 Man Don 2-2]]


:: MFC2 Man Beth 3-1 [S:Beth T:Don]
Too late for that, now. What, exactly, is the problem?

[[MURDER!|MFC2 Man Don 1-5]]
[[Have you seen any strange men around?|MFC2 Man Don 2-1]]
[[Never mind|MFC2 Man Don 4-1]]


:: MFC2 Man Don 1-6 [S:Don]
Yes, yes, perfectly safe. I've seen nothing down this end of the train. Just doing an inspection to make sure the evil-doer isn't hiding out here.

[[MFC2 Man Beth 1-6]]


:: MFC2 Man Sally 4-1 [S:Sally T:Beth Start:Leave]
What a peculiar fellow.
[[MFC2 Man Beth 4-1]]


:: MFC2 Man Don 1-8 [S:Don T:Sally]
Good, good. I'd best be on my way then.




:: MFC2 Man Sally 1-7 [S:Sally T:Don]
And walk through the lower-class car? I wouldn't dream of it!

[[MFC2 Man Don 1-8]]


:: MFC2 Man Don 1-7 [S:Don]
No need to worry, everything is perfectly fine. Just don't go into the luggage compartment. 

[[MFC2 Man Sally 1-7]]


:: MFC2 Man Beth 1-6 [S:Beth T:Don]
Thank the lord for that. You certainly gave us a fright.

[[MFC2 Man Don 1-7]]


:: MFC2 Man Beth 4-1 [S:Beth T:Sally]
I hope he doesn't come back here.
