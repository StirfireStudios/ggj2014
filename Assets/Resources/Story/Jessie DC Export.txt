I'm bored. Can I play with you?

[[CDC1 Child Ben 3-1]]


:: CDC1 Child Ben 3-1 [S:Ben T:Jessie]
'Fraid not, son. We're doing important police work. 


[[You're eating supper.|CDC1 Child Jessie 2-2]]
[[Ok, bye.|CDC1 Child Jessie 4-5]]

You're eating supper.

Hahaha, he's got you there, sarge. 

[[CDC1 Child Ben 2-2]]

Yeah, he does. 
[[CDC1 Child Ben 2-3]]

Now, do you need something? Or are you gonna leave us to eat our supper?

[[I can't find my mummy.|CDC1 Child Jessie 4-1]]

Two police officers are sitting at a table. Their hats are on the table. They are discussing the Dandelion Killer. 

[[CDC1 Bill 1-1]]


:: CDC1 Ben 1-1 [S:Ben T:Bill]
We'll get him, Bill. He can't hide forever.

[[CDC1 Bill 1-2]]


:: CDC1 Bill 3-1 [S:Bill T:Ben]
You don't say! Fancy that for a laugh.
[[CDC1 Ben 3-2]]

What's all this, then? Who might you be?

[[CDC1 Child Jessie 1-1]]


:: CDC1 Child Jessie 1-1 [S:Jessie T:Ben]
Hi! I'm Jessie. Are you police mans?

[[CDC1 Child Ben 1-2]]


:: CDC1 Child Ben 1-2 [S:Ben T:Jessie]
That's right, son. What are you doing all on your own?

[[Can I wear your hat?|CDC1 Child Jessie 2-1]]
[[I'm bored.|CDC1 Child Jessie 3-1]]
[[I can't find my mummy.|CDC1 Child Jessie 4-1]]


:: CDC1 Child Jessie 2-1 [S:Jessie T:Ben]
Can I wear your hat? I want to be a police man!
[[CDC1 Child Ben 2-1]]


:: CDC1 Child Ben 2-1 [S:Ben T:Jessie]
Not right now.

[[Where's my mummy?|CDC1 Child Jessie 4-1]]
[[Ok, bye.|CDC1 Child Jessie 4-5]]


:: CDC1 Child Jessie 4-5 [S:Jessie T:Ben]
Ok, bye. 

[[CDC1 Child Bill 5-1]]


:: CDC1 Child Bill 5-1 [S:Bill T:Ben Start:Leave]
Cute kid.

What were we talking about? 



:: CDC1 Bill 1-2 [S:Bill T:Ben]
You reckon? I ain't sure. We're stretched thin, here.

[[CDC1 Ben 2-1]]


:: CDC1 Ben 3-2 [S:Ben T:Bill]
Yeah, me pa used to tell me I'd never get out of that place. I sure showed her!
[[CDC1 Bill 3-2]]


:: CDC1 Bill 5-2 [S:Bill T:Ben]
--
I could'a swear'd I heard a scream.

[[CDC1 Ben 5-2]]


:: CDC1 Child Jessie 4-1 [S:Jessie T:Ben]
I don't know where my mummy went. Can you find her?

[[CDC1 Child Ben 4-1]]


:: CDC1 Child Ben 4-1 [S:Ben T:Jessie]
Oh dear, that is a problem. 

[[CDC1 Child Jessie 4-2]]


:: CDC1 Child Jessie 4-2 [S:Jessie T:Ben]
Can you help me?

[[CDC1 Child Bill 4-2]]


:: CDC1 Child Bill 4-2 [S:Bill T:Ben]
Little kid, all alone. Ma nowhere 'round. We should help, Sarge.

Noone is sitting at this table. On top of the table is a bouquet of dandelions in a vase. 
Under the table is a pistol with <i>Jessie</i> written on it. 
[[CDCE1 Jessie]]


:: CDCE1 Jessie [Prop:Gun S:Jessie]
This looks just like my gun! I left it in the back with Mummy. 

--

Wait, this <i>is</i> my gun. So which gun is with Mummy?


:: CDC1 Bill 3-2 [S:Bill T:Ben]
By gosh you did! Sarge of Scottland Yard.
[[CDC1 Ben 3-3]]


:: CDC1 Ben 5-2 [S:Ben T:Bill]
Nah, you're imagining things. It's just <color=#ffa500ff>The Dandelion Killer</color> gettin' you on edge.

!!!!!BANG


:: CDC1 Child Ben 4-2 [S:Ben T:Bill]
Too right, Bill, too right.

[[CDC1 Child Ben 4-3]]


:: CDC1 Child Ben 4-3 [S:Ben T:Jessie]
Where was your mummy last, Jessie?

[[CDC1 Child Jessie 4-3]]


:: CDC1 Child Jessie 4-3 [S:Jessie T:Ben]
Right at the back, near the dark room.

[[CDC1 Child Ben 4-4]]


:: CDC1 Child Ben 4-4 [S:Ben T:Jessie]
You go back there, Jessie. I'll talk to the driver, and come get you when we find her.
[[CDC1 Child Jessie 4-4]]


:: CDC1 Child Jessie 4-4 [S:Jessie T:Ben]
<i>NO!</i> I don't want to go to the dark room!

[[CDC1 Child Ben 4-5]] 


:: CDC1 Child Ben 4-5 [S:Ben T:Jessie]
That's ok. You just wait outside the dark room. I'll find your mother and take her to you. 

[[Ok, bye.|CDC1 Child Jessie 4-5]]


:: CDCE2 [Ignore]
The table is unoccupied. There are the remnants of food on the table. Under the table is a single dandelion and a photo of Don.

[[CDCE2 Jessie]]


:: CDCE2 Jessie [Prop:DonPhoto S:Jessie]
It's that mean man. He was yelling at Mummy. 


:: CDC1 Ben 3-3 [S:Ben T:Bill]
With my best mate by me side.

[[CDC1 Ben 4-1]]


:: CDC1 Bill 5-3 [S:Bill T:Ben]
Yeah, s'pose you're right. 
[[Gunshot]]


:: CDC2 Child Jessie 1-2 [S:Jessie T:Grace]
Is that your boyfriend? He's pretty.

[[CDC2 Child Dirk 1-1]]


:: CDC2 Child Dirk 1-1 [S:Dirk T:Grace]
Kid's got good taste. Maybe you've got similar sensibilities, Grace?

[[CDC2 Child Grace 1-3]]


:: CDC2 Child Grace 1-3 [S:Grace T:Dirk]
Oh Dirk, you're a real card. You know I'm engaged to a wonderful man in London.

[[Is he pretty?|CDC2 Child Jessie 1-5]]
[[So your husband's rich, then?|CDC2 Child Jessie 1-6]]


:: CDC2 Child Jessie 1-5 [S:Jessie T:Grace]
Is he pretty, like your friend?

[[CDC2 Child Dirk 1-2]]


:: CDC2 Child Dirk 1-2 [T:Dirk S:Grace]
Yes, Grace; is he pretty like me?

[[CDC2 Child Grace 1-4]]


:: CDC2 [Ignore]
Grace and Dirk (DK). They are sitting and having a pleasent conversation about lovely things. 


:: CDC2 Dirk 1-1 [StartNode S:Dirk T:Grace]
--120s

Well, now, aren't you just the prettiest thing!

[[CDC2 Grace 1-1]]


:: CDC2 Grace 1-1 [S:Grace T:Dirk]
You're very nice, but I already have a boyfriend.
[[CDC2 Dirk 1-2]]


:: CDC2 Dirk 1-2 [S:Dirk T:Grace]
A lady as lovely as yourself? I've no doubt. 

[[CDC2 Grace 1-2]]


:: CDC2 Grace 1-2 [S:Grace T:Dirk]
Hahaha, you should count yourself lucky that my fiance isn't riding with me.
[[CDC2 Dirk 1-3]]


:: CDC2 Dirk 1-3 [S:Dirk T:Grace]
Travelling alone? A dangerous habit for someone of your class.

[[CDC2 Grace 1-3]]


:: CDC2 Grace 1-3 [S:Grace T:Dirk]
I'm not wealthy, sir. At least not yet. And I am hardly alone. My father rides this very train with me.

[[CDC2 Dirk 1-4]]


:: CDC2 Child Grace 1-1 [S:Grace T:Jessie Start:Approach]
Hey there, little one. Where's your mummy?

[[I don't know. Have you seen her?|CDC2 Child Jessie 1-1]]
[[Is that your boyfriend?|CDC2 Child Jessie 1-2]]


:: CDC2 Child Jessie 1-6 [S:Jessie T:Grace]
So your husband has lots of money?

[[CDC2 Child Grace 1-5]]


:: CDC2 Child Grace 1-5 [S:Grace T:Jessie]
Not my husband yet, little one. We're to be married soon, though; real soon, if my father has his say.

[[CDC2 Child Jessie 1-7]]


:: CDC2 Child Jessie 1-7 [S:Jessie T:Grace]
Ew, adults are gross. I'm leaving.

[[CDC2 Child Dirk 1-3]]


:: CDC2 Child Dirk 1-3 [S:Dirk T:Grace Start:Leave]
So, soon-to-be-wedded Grace, tell me more about your big man in the big city...



:: CDC2 Dirk 1-4 [S:Dirk T:Grace]
It is a criminal act on his part to leave you unattended. Why, here you are convorting with a stranger when you are to be married. Hardly seemly of you.

[[CDC2 Grace 1-4]]


:: CDC2 Grace 1-4 [S:Grace T:Dirk]
And will you protect me, good sir? Will you vouch for my honour?

[[CDC2 Dirk 1-5]]


:: CDC2 Dirk 1-5 [S:Dirk T:Grace]
I'll hear of nothing less! 

[[CDC2 Grace 1-5]]


:: CDC2 Grace 1-5 [S:Grace T:Dirk]
There, you see? I am well cared for. My father will be glad that you and I crossed paths.

[[CDC2 Dirk 1-6]]


:: CDC2 Dirk 1-6 [S:Dirk T:Grace]
And where is this father of yours? You assure me he accompanies you, and yet I've seen neither hide nor hair of him since we began this torrid affair.

[[CDC2 Grace 1-6]]


:: CDC2 Grace 1-6 [S:Grace T:Dirk]
Watch your tongue, sir. My father is dealing with a personal matter. I am sure he will be along presently.


:: CDC2 Child Jessie 1-1 [S:Jessie T:Grace]
I don't know. Have you seen her?

[[CDC2 Child Grace 1-2]]


:: CDC2 Child Grace 1-2 [S:Grace T:Jessie]
I haven't, sweety. What about your daddy?

[[CDC2 Child Jessie 1-4]]


:: CDC2 Child Jessie 1-4 [S:Jessie T:Grace]
He's not here. We're going to visit him in the big city in his big house.

[[CDC2 Child Grace 1-6]]


:: CDC2 Child Grace 1-6 [S:Grace T:Jessie]
What a coincidence; I'm going to visit my fiancé in his big house in the city as well.

[[Is he pretty, like your friend?|CDC2 Child Jessie 1-5]]
[[So your husband's rich, then?|CDC2 Child Jessie 1-6]]


:: CDC2 Child Grace 1-4 [S:Grace T:Dirk]
Oh, you're a right rascal, you are! You know looks aren't everything in a man of standing...

[[So your husband's rich, then?|CDC2 Child Jessie 1-6]]
[[Ew, adults are gross.|CDC2 Child Jessie 1-7]]
