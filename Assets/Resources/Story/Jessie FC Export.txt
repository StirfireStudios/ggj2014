A man and woman are in this compartment. The woman is looking out the window. The man is reading a paper. The headline reads "Dandelion Killer Still At Large"


:: CFC1 John1-1 [S:John T:Mavis StartNode]
Have you read the papers, Mavis?

Damn these modern railways. No structure. In my day we kept our tracks up to standard. None of this "falts in the line" business.

Useless, these men are, useless.

I'm bored! Will you play with me?

[[CFC2 Child Sally 1-2]]


:: CFC2 Child Sally 1-2 [S:Sally T:Jessie]
Not right now, dear.

[[Ok, bye!|CFC2 Child Jessie 3-1]]
[[Have you seen my mummy?|CFC2 Child Jessie 2-1]]


:: CFC2 Child Jessie 3-1 [S:Jessie T:Beth]
Ok, bye.

I know dear.

Looks like it's about to get dark again. 



:: CFC2 Child Beth 1-1 [S:Beth T:Sally Start:Approach]
Oh, goodness, there's a child in the room!
[[CFC2 Child Sally 1-1]]


:: CFC2 Child Sally 1-1 [S:Sally T:Jessie]
What are you doing here, little one?

[[I'm bored.|CFC2 Child Jessie 1-1]]
[[Have you seen my mummy?|CFC2 Child Jessie 2-1]]


:: CFC2 Child Beth 2-1 [S:Beth T:Jessie]
Mummy probably needs her sleep. Run along now!

[[Ok, bye.|CFC2 Child Jessie 3-1]]



:: CFC1 John 1-2 [S:John T:Mavis]
They still haven't caught <color=#ffa500ff>The Dandelion Killer</color>. It's getting to be your aren't safe in you're own home. Isn't it, Mavis?

[[CFC1 Mavis 1-2]]


:: CFC1 John 2-2 [S:John T:Mavis]
We worked good and hard, and we were glad for the work! 

[[CFC1 Mavis 2-2]]


:: CFC2 Child Jessie 2-1 [S:Jessie T:Beth]
Have you seen my mummy?

[[CFC2 Child Beth 2-2]]


:: CFC2 Child Beth 2-2 [S:Beth T:Jessie]
When did you see your mummy last?

[[We were playing Cops and Robbers.|CFC2 Child Jessie 2-3]]


:: CFC2 Child Jessie 2-3 [S:Jessie T:Beth]
We were playing Cops and Robbers. Then she fell asleep. 
[[CFC2 Child Beth 2-1]]


:: CFC1 Mavis 1-2 [S:Mavis T:John]
Mmm hmm 

[[CFC1 John 2-1]]


:: CFC1 Mavis 2-2 [S:Mavis T:John]
Yes, dear.

And then Georgia said to Clarice that he needed to ask permission first, but Clarice said that was outdated.
[[CFC2 Sally 1-1]]


:: CFC2 Beth 2-1 [S:Beth T:Sally]
That's different, you see, because Elton is from the Wentworth family. And we all know that they haven't got enough money to their name for that to be a suitable match.
[[CFC2 Sally 2-1]]


:: CFC2 Beth 3-1 [S:Beth T:Sally]
True, true, but Darcy's family has been around for at least ten generations. 

[[CFC2 Sally 3-1]]


:: CFC2 Beth 4-1 [S:Beth T:Sally]
She has to marry someone, though. And soon! She's nearly 25 already. Who would you have her be with, Leeroy Jenkins?

[[CFC2 Sally 4-1]]


:: CFC2 Beth 5-1 [S:Beth T:Sally]
Oh but that's such an outdated custom, not suitable for this day and age. It's the twenties, Sally, you must move with the times!

[[CFC2 Sally 5-1]]

Two women are chatting about a tennis match.




:: CFC2 Sally 1-1 [S:Sally T:Beth]
But didn't Elton ask permission before marrying Clarice?
[[CFC2 Beth 2-1]]


:: CFC2 Sally 2-1 [S:Sally T:Beth]
But Darcy's family certainly isn't well-off. They barely make enough to afford their estate!

[[CFC2 Beth 3-1]]


:: CFC2 Sally 3-1 [S:Sally T:Beth]
Prestige is very well and good, but how does he expect to support Georgia when his house is barely making ends meet?

[[CFC2 Beth 4-1]]


:: CFC2 Sally 4-1 [S:Sally T:Beth]
At least Leeroy would ask her father before asking for her hand!

[[CFC2 Beth 5-1]]


:: CFC2 Sally 5-1 [S:Sally T:Beth]
All I'm saying is that if a man wishes to ask for my hand, he had better ask my father first.
